SCENE Datalake 
===

Data Lake  developed inside the [SCENE project](https://thesceneproject.eu/). 
SCENE has been financed by the Horizon Europe programme under Grant Agreement No 101095303

The data lake also includes the SCENE ontology,  covering knowledge areas from the film-making industry.




Usage and Documentation
===

The data lake provides a **set of tools** including a visual viewer, REST APIs for the associated data lakes, etc. They use Docker containers and are publicly available in DockerHub. The **docker** folder includes a docker-compose file that shows a basic usage of the whole set (TBC). You might test it in your own computer after correct local configuration, including domain changes and valid SSL certificates.
*Note: The given docker-compose file is basic and should be improved for production environments (e.g., mounting volumes to change configuration, persist logs and databases, use of Kubernetes instead of docker-compose)



License
===

The SCENE ontology and the set of tools are distributed through [Apache2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license (TBC).
